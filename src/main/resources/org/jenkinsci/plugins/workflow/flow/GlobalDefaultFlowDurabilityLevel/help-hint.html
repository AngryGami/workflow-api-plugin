        This setting provides a trade-off between how fast pipelines run and their "durability", or ability to survive unexpected failures while running.

        <br><strong>Facts:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The lowest durability modes (suggested) can be MUCH faster and write to disk FAR less often.</li>
            <li>All pipelines persist their data when they complete/fail, are paused, or the master restarts gracefully.</li>
            <li>Running pipelines that do NOT persist data with every step (lower durability settings) may lose data if Jenkins is not shut down gracefully.</li>
            <li>Pipelines may not be able to resume or be visualized if they cannot persist data.</li>
            <li>If a running pipeline loses data, you can always run the pipeline again.</li>
            <li>Pipelines will generally write log data regardless of durability settings.</li>
            <li>Some modes use an "atomic write" option - this helps ensure that files aren't overwritten or left partially written if something fails.</li>
            <li>Atomic writes may place more stress on filesystems, so especially with networked storage it may be faster not to use them.</li>
        </ul>

        <em>Note: </em>Individual pipelines (and multibranch projects) may configure custom overrides to these defaults.
